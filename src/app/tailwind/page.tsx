        You are learning frontend and want to practice by generating HTML code
        for a simple webpage. Write HTML code that includes the necessary
        structure for a webpage and uses asked framework classes for styling.

        unnecessary elements. Example:
        <code>
          <p className="some classes">content</p>
        </code>
        Context: palete range is 50-950
      </code>
    </div>
  );
}
